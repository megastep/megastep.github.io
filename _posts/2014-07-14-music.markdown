### Listening

While I enjoy listening to a wide variety of different music styles, from classical to jazz fusion all the way to extreme death metal, I am particularly passionate about modern progressive rock in its various incarnations.

Some of my favorite artists in that genre include:

* [Spock's Beard](https://www.spocksbeard.com/) - one of the top acts in the genre today, I became a huge fan since I first saw them live. I have also become the official online manager for their keyboardist, [Ryo Okumoto](https://www.ryookumoto.com), and I help manage his online presence and social accounts.
* [Neal Morse](https://nealmorse.com/) was the founding member of *Spock's Beard*, and left to pursue a solo career focused on Christian prog. An incredibly prolific artist and definitely one of the founding fathers of Modern Prog.
* [Dream Theater](https://www.dreamtheater.net), the gold standard for metal-infused musicianship. John Petrucci is one of my favorite guitarists and I play his signature [MusicMan guitar](https://www.music-man.com/instruments/guitars/john-petrucci.html).
* [Opeth](https://www.opeth.com), a Swedish death-metal band that evolved into one of the most innovative prog bands today.
* [Steven Wilson](https://www.stevenwilson.com), along with [Porcupine Tree](https://porcupinetree.com/), is one of the flag-bearers of modern progressive rock.
* [The Flower Kings](https://www.flowerkings.se), another very prolific Swedish progressive rock band. [Roine Stolt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roine_Stolt) is another pillar of modern prog.
* [Pain of Salvation](https://painofsalvation.com), yet another very eclectic progressive rock/metal band from Sweden. Daniel Gildenlow is a genius.
* [Transatlantic](https://www.transatlanticweb.com), a prog supergroup started by members from *Spock's Beard*, *Dream Theater*, the *Flower Kings* and *Marillion*. A big gateway drug for me when I started exploring the genre.
* [Mike Keneally](https://www.keneally.com/), an all-around musical genius and Frank Zappa alumnus who is a fixture of the LA prog scene. I try to catch as many of his live shows as I can.
* [Heliopolis](https://www.facebook.com/HeliopolisLAProg), a brilliant new prog band on the LA scene (and cool friends to boot).
* ... and so much more.

On the more popular side, these bands are considered foundational to progressive rock and really helped shape my taste in music:

* *Queen*, my first love with rock music. *Bohemian Rhapsody* is still my favorite song to this day.
* *Pink Floyd*, the kings of psychedelic prog.
* *Rush*, on the harder side of prog.
* *Yes*, who with *Genesis* and *King Crimson* defined the early days of prog in the 70s.

### Attending

I go to **a lot** of live shows, and living in Los Angeles we are very fortunate to have access to regular performances by some of the top musicians in the world. I can honestly say that I go out to see more live concerts than movies in theaters.

I can be spotted very often at gigs of my favorite artists around town, and I am a regular at the [Baked Potato](https://www.thebakedpotato.com/) club in Studio City. So much great music happening all the time there, this place almost feels like a second home to me.

[CalProg](https://www.calprog.com/) is a great organization putting up consistently awesome prog shows in Southern California. I am proud to have been a regular patron since its inception back in 2003, although they have since stopped putting together their annual festival.

### Performing

My first musical instrument was the keyboard, for which I had lessons as a kid after showing an early interest. I even started writing my own music as a child.
These days, my favorite instrument is the electric guitar. I bought my first *Ibanez RG* at the Guitar Center store in Hollywood in 2001 and am completely self-taught.

I later expanded to other stringed instruments and can be occasionally spotted playing electric bass with the [Peninsula Symphonic Winds](https://www.facebook.com/peninsulawinds) in Palos Verdes, where my wife also performs on French horn.

I have also started learning to play the drums in the summer of 2017. I have been posting a few [videos of my progress](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNol9N3PeBA&list=PLiVitMbI4-yAncHiApWppgRNkgveXne3b) on my YouTube channel.

I am otherwise not currently part of any band or studio project, though I have been known to occasionally write and record music in my home studio.

For a recent performance of my guitar playing, here is a video of myself performing the classic "Johnny B. Goode" at my wedding in July 2014.

### Managing

Through my new company [Catloaf Productions](https://catloafprod.com/), I have had the privilege to help some of my favorite musicians with their online presence, social media, marketing and other business needs. Most notable mentions are [Ryo Okumoto](https://www.ryookumoto.com) from my favorite band [Spock's Beard](https://www.spocksbeard.com/) and [ProgJect](https://www.progject.com/), a prog supergroup he recently joined. It is truly a labor of love for me!
