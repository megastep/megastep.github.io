### Mobile Applications

* [Fretuoso](https://fretuoso.app/) is an educational game for learning the fretboard of the guitar, bass and other stringed instruments.
* [Text With](https://textwith.me) is a series of educational AI chatbot apps, allowing the user to have deep conversations with historical figures (in [Text With History](https://textwith.me/history/)), popular authors (in [Text With Authors](https://textwith.me/authors/)) and Biblical characters (in [Text With Jesus](https://textwith.me/jesus/)). The apps are powered by the *ChatGPT* engine from OpenAI, and are available for free on the Apple App Store, [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=8182293785712256064) and as a [Web app](https://textwith.app/).
* [Texts From](https://texts.fr), a series of simple apps used to get daily quotes from [Jesus](https://jesus.texts.fr), [Oscar Wilde](https://wilde.texts.fr), [Donald Trump](https://trump.texts.fr), [Bernie Sanders](https://bernie.texts.fr),  or the [Founding Fathers of the United States](https://fathers.texts.fr).
* [Play Him Off, Keyboard Cat!](https://iphonekeyboardcat.com/), my first iOS app, was essentially a convenient archive of [Keyboard Cat](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/keyboard-cat) mashup videos, a YouTube meme that became very popular around 2009. It is no longer being maintained.

### Java Mobile Applications (J2ME)

* [Guitar Trainer](https://www.mobiletutor.org/guitar) was originally written for older mobile phones (including *Blackberry*), as a J2ME app that could be purchased directly from my [MobileTutor.org](https://www.mobiletutor.org) website. The last version is now free to download.
* Before the advent of online marketplaces such as the App Store and Google Play, the [MobileTutor.org](https://www.mobiletutor.org) store backend was entirely designed from scratch, with payment processing through PayPal, Amazon, Google Checkout and a number of other mobile payment processors.

### Other Catloaf Businesses

* [Catloaf Productions](https://catloafprod.com) is dedicated to website design, video production and online artist management.
* [Catloaf Art](https://catloaf.art) is an online outlet where you can purchase my wife's paintings.
* [Catloaf ASMR](https://catloafasmr.com) is a small side project, producing ASMR videos on YouTube for relaxation.
