I do most of my video editing in [Adobe Premiere Pro](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html).

### YouTube Channels

* [My main channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/megastep), where I post a variety of things. Lots of footage from concerts I attended, the occasional personal videos, etc.
* The [Catloaf ASMR](https://catloafasmr.com) YouTube channel is exploring a new interest of mine, [ASMR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_sensory_meridian_response) videos that help trigger feelings of relaxation in some people.
* I manage the official [Ryo Okumoto](https://www.youtube.com/RyoOkumoto) YouTube channel and related social pages, and occasionally produce some of the videos posted there (via [Catloaf Productions](https://catloafprod.com)).
* I also manage the official [ProgJect](https://www.youtube.com/ProgJectBand) YouTube channel!
* The [Catloaf Software](https://www.youtube.com/user/catloafsoft) channel mostly contains promotional videos for our apps.
* I maintain the [Peninsula Symphonic Winds](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLs0HjcVt8pEJqNknpQD14A) channel, as well as do most of the filming and editing of the concert videos being posted there.
* A more [personal channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/stephanepetercx), mostly for family in France. This is where you'll find our wedding footage.

### Other Sites

* I also have a few videos posted on my [Vimeo account](https://vimeo.com/megastep).
