description: UNIX systems have been an early love in my career as a software developer.<br/>As an early adopter of Linux, all the way to the foundation of modern systems from Apple and Google, UNIX technologies are an important part of my daily work.

### Codehost, Inc.

I am currently the lead software engineer for [Codehost](https://www.codehost.com/), where I designed [BrightQ](https://www.codehost.com/brightq/), a user-friendly suite of software to distribute and setup printer drivers, based in part on Apple's [CUPS](https://www.cups.org/). Besides Linux, the software was also ported to *Solaris*, *AIX*, *FreeBSD*, and HP-*UX*, with past ports to *SCO* and *IRIX*.

It is currently the official UNIX solution for [Canon](https://www.codehost.com/canon/) MFPs in North America, and is also available for other major manufacturers including [Ricoh](https://www.codehost.com/ricoh/), [Sharp](https://www.codehost.com/sharp/), and more.

I am also a seasoned Linux systems administrator, and was responsible for developing critical aspects of the Codehost licensing server.

### Loki Software, Inc.

I worked on the Linux ports of several major video game titles while working at [Loki](https://www.lokigames.com/). These included:

* [Myth II: Soulblighter](https://www.lokigames.com/products/myth2/)
* [Heroes of Might & Magic III](https://www.lokigames.com/products/heroes3/)
* [SimCity 3000 Unlimited](https://www.lokigames.com/products/sc3k/)
* [Kohan: Immortal Sovereign](https://www.lokigames.com/products/kohan/)

As a developer, I also helped build the then-nascent infrastructure for Linux gaming and worked on several related open-source projects that live on to this day:

* [Loki Setup](https://github.com/megastep/loki_setup), now ported to a variety of other Unix systems and used by Codehost's [BrightQ](https://www.brightq.com/).
* [Makeself](https://makeself.io), initially a relatively simple shell script for creating self-extracting archives I built while at *SciTech*, it is now used as the basis of many popular installers and packages for UNIX systems.
* [Simple Directmedia Layer](https://libsdl.org/): SDL was the core library used when porting games to Linux, and I contributed several patches during my tenure at Loki - including a fun ASCII-art video driver!

### SciTech Software, Inc.

One of my first experiences as a professional Linux developer was porting the (now defunct) [SciTech Display Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UniVBE) suite of display drivers to Linux, back in 1998.

I also participated in the Linux port of SciTech's MGL graphics library that was in use by major video game studios at the time, providing direct hardware access to video cards on PC.
