description: I have always been a strong proponent of Open-Source Software.<br/>I maintain a number of public projects on both my <a href="https://github.com/megastep">personal GitHub</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/catloafsoft">Catloaf Software organization</a>.

My most popular projects include:

* [Makeself](https://makeself.io), a popular Unix packaging tool used to create self-extracting archives and installers. Besides projects for my employers, it has been used by companies such as *Google*, *nVIDIA*, *Oracle*, and more.
* [Loki Setup](https://github.com/megastep/loki_setup), the original Loki Games installer, which I still use in conjunction with *Makeself* to build graphical installers for UNIX applications.
* [FBUtility](https://github.com/catloafsoft/FBUtility), a library to help with interfacing with the popular [Facebook iOS SDK](https://github.com/facebook/facebook-ios-sdk) and which is used by all apps from Catloaf Software.
* ... and a number of forks I have contributed to over the years, in a variety of platforms and languages.

### AudioKit

[AudioKit](https://audiokit.io) is a new open-source audio framework, which was first based on the venerable [Csound](https://www.csounds.com) but now relies on a bevy of technologies including the [Soundpipe](https://github.com/PaulBatchelor/Soundpipe) engine. AudioKit makes it easy for iOS developers to develop powerful audio applications in Objective-C and Swift.

Since April 2015, I have joined the [AudioKit](https://github.com/audiokit) organization as a developer and have contributed many commits, including helping reorganizing AudioKit as a proper static library, lots of general fixes, improvements to audio plots, and more.

I look forward to further contributions to this project as its potential is great for anybody interested in writing audio applications for iOS - including myself!
